### What I Set Out to Do

Today I set out to code left().

---

### What I Actually Did

I did indeed finish coding left(), using array manipulations, for loops and many conditionals. The function takes a 4 x 4 array as an arg and returns a tuple, including the board after the left arrow is pressed, and the score change after the tiles have been combined (like in "real" 2048, each new tile's value is added to the score when a move is made).

### What I Learned or Noticed

Today, I learned from the experience of troubleshooting my code how to deal with conditionals that are too long; I needed to split them up into multiple conditionals and combined them in a later variable. Additionally, I learned how to determine how many for loops are necessary for more complex processes. I initially tried using a while loop - which would definitely be better - but I couldn't figure out how to create the conditional. If I have the time on Friday, I will use it to figure out the while loop.

### What's Next

Tomorrow's mission is to create the right(), up() and down() functions.
