### What I Set Out to Do

Today I set out to code left().

---

### What I Actually Did

I did indeed finish coding left(), using array manipulations, for loops and many conditionals. The function takes a 4 x 4 array as an arg and returns a tuple, including the board after the left arrow is pressed, and the score change after the tiles have been combined (like in "real" 2048, each new tile's value is added to the score when a move is made).

### What I Learned or Noticed

[What did you take away from your work this week?
It could be technical (like learning how to use Pygame or CSS Grid), strategic (such as finding a better way to plan), or personal (like discovering how you stay motivated). Your takeaway might be small (figuring out a tricky method or function) or big (like realizing how much you’ve grown as a problem solver).
Try to be specific—

For example: 
   * This: ✅ “During class, we discussed dictionaries and I realized that I can use them to organize player stats way more cleanly than using parallel lists.”

   * NOT this: ❌ “This week helped me realize I actually enjoy debugging when I understand the bigger picture.”]
