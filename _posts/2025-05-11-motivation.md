### Project Focus

For my Final Quest, I will be building a text-based 2048 game which users can play using arrow buttons on their keyboard. For those unfamiliar with the game, 2048 involves a 4x4 grid with number tiles that the user can move up, left, right, or down in order to combine two tiles of identical value into a single tile of their values' sum.

### Why This Project 

I am extremely good at 2048 and play it all the time, which is why I decided on this idea for my Final Quest. I believe this project will be a perfect difficulty for me -- challenging enough to engage my mind and teach me something, while also building upon concepts I learned in class.

### What I Want to Learn

For this project I would like to learn to use the pygame module. Also, I will continue to develop my design skills to implement my code elegantly and effectively.

---

### My Approach 

For the next 5 days I plan to work 1 hour per day. First I will focus on my implementation by using user input text (in case I don't have time to finish the pygame tutorial). Then I will switch focus to learning about pygame. When I have achieved a functional code that successfully creates a playable 2048 with no functional differences from the "real" 2048, I will consider my project done. It does not, however, need to look identical.

My code will essentially work through 5 different functions; 4 for each directional movement and 1 for incorporating pygame and putting everything together. A timeline of my next five days is below.

---

### Timeline

Day 1 - code left().

Day 2 - code right(), up(), and down(), based on left().

Day 3 - study pygame tutorial on keyboard interaction.

Day 4 - incorporate pygame into my colab notebook.

Day 5 - revise all code for elegance, efficiency and efficacy.

---

### What's Next

Day one will include coding left() in Colab.
